## Task 2: Understanding AI, ML, and DL Through a Diagram  

### What I Learned:  
- I gained a clearer understanding of the hierarchical structure among Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).  
- Creating a visual representation made it easier to see how ML is a subset of AI, while DL is a subset of ML.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Designing a visually appealing and easy-to-understand diagram was a bit challenging.  
- Simplifying the relationships while retaining important details was difficult.  

### Final Thought:  
Using diagrams helped me grasp complex concepts better, and I plan to incorporate more visuals in my learning process.

## Task 3: Researching Data Science Job Roles  

### What I Learned:  
- Data Science is a multidisciplinary field with roles ranging from Data Analyst to Machine Learning Engineer.  
- Some positions emphasize coding and model development, while others focus more on business intelligence and data-driven decision-making.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Differentiating between similar roles, such as Data Scientist and Data Engineer, was initially confusing.  
- Summarizing role descriptions concisely while maintaining clarity was challenging.  

### Final Thought:  
This research helped me appreciate the variety of roles within Data Science and the importance of both technical and analytical skills.

## Task 4: Applying the Data Science Lifecycle  

### What I Learned:  
- The Data Science process involves multiple structured steps, from problem identification to deployment and monitoring.  
- Each phase, including data collection, cleaning, and feature selection, is crucial for building effective models.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Applying the lifecycle to a specific real-world example required careful breakdown and analysis.  
- Differentiating between closely related steps, such as data preprocessing and feature engineering, was a bit tricky.  

### Final Thought:  
Understanding the Data Science Lifecycle in detail has reinforced my knowledge of end-to-end model development and its real-world implications.
