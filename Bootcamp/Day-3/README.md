The task given is fully based on the python oops concepts , i have already learned this in the past days and its like refreshing the contents again . 
Its very useful for the code implementation and also for my placement preparation , i have learned a lot and clearly the concepts such as 'How the class is
created and the methods, parameters passed to it and also the inheritance concepts that is how the child class inherit the parents class and access its properties
and also the encapsulation topics such as the private class uses "__" [double underscore],protected using single underscore and public with no underscores 
Also the polymorphism , which is the morphing of a actual structure of the code .
