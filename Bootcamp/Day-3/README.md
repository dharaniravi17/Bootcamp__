## Task: Revisiting Python OOP Concepts  

### What I Learned:  
- This task served as a refresher on Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
- I reviewed how to define **classes** and their associated **methods**, along with passing parameters effectively.  
- I gained a deeper understanding of **inheritance**, where a child class inherits properties from a parent class.  
- I explored **encapsulation**, learning how private (`__`), protected (`_`), and public attributes are handled in Python.  
- I revisited **polymorphism**, which allows flexibility in code structure by modifying existing functionalities.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Since I had already learned OOP concepts before, recalling every detail and applying it in new scenarios was slightly challenging.  
- Understanding how encapsulation works in real-world applications required some additional practice.  

### Final Thought:  
This task was extremely useful for reinforcing my Python OOP knowledge. It not only helped in better code implementation but also strengthened my preparation for placements.
